### ðŸ’¯ NeurIPS 2019 Competition Submissions Open

We are so excited to announce that Round 1 of the MineRL NeurIPS 2019 Competition is
now open for submissions! Our partners at AIcrowd just released their
[competition submission starter kit](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2019_minerl_challenge_starter_kit) that you can find [here](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2019_minerl_challenge_starter_kit).

**Here's how you submit in Round 1**:
1. **Sign up** to join the competition [on the AIcrowd website.](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2019-minerl-competition)
2. **Clone** the [AIcrowd starter template](https://github.com/minerllabs/competition_submission_starter_template) and start developing your submissions.
3. **Submit** an agent to the leaderboard:
    - **Train your agents locally** (or on Azure) in under **8,000,000 samples** over **4 days**. Participants should use hardware **no more powerful than NG6v2 instances on Azure** (6 CPU cores, 112 GiB RAM, 736 GiB SDD, and a NVIDIA P100 GPU.) 
    - **Push your repository to [AIcrowd GitLab](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com)**, which verifies that it can successfully be re-trained by the organizers at the end of Round 1 and then runs the test entrypoint to evaluate the trained agent's performance! 

Once the full evaluation of the uploaded model/code is done, the participant's submission will appear on the leaderboard!
