### ðŸ’¯ MineRL 0.2.0 released (new data, update now)!
<img src="/assets/videos/cropped_viewer.gif" width="100%"/>

We are excited to announce a HUGE update for `minerl` and the dataset **UPGRADE FOR FIXED DATA!**


The package is now on `minerl-0.2.0`, and we have released a new version of the dataset! To upgrade:
{% highlight bash %}
pip3 install --upgrade minerl
{% endhighlight %}
Then **get the new dataset** by running the following in `python3!`  
{% highlight python %}

import minerl
minerl.data.download('your/dataset/path`) 

{% endhighlight %}

#### **Changes in** `minerl-0.2.0`:

* Adds `minerl.viewer`, [a new tool to visualize your the data](http://www.minerl.io/docs/tutorials/data_sampling.html#visualizing-the-data-minerl-viewer). Try it out on a random trajectory by running:

{% highlight bash %}
 # Make sure your MINERL_DATA_ROOT is set!
 export MINERL_DATA_ROOT='/your/local/path'

 # Visualizes a random trajectory 
 python3 -m minerl.viewer MineRLObtainDiamondDense-v0

{% endhighlight %}
* Fixes an issue where the camera values are outside the interval [-180, 180] (#66)
* Fixes an issue where there were invalid enum fields in the craft actions (#67)
* Fixes an issue where the compass angle of a demonstration in the navigate task was always non-positive. (#75)
* Fixes an issue where NavigateExtremeDense-v0 had extreme rewads (#76)
* Adds a suppressor for the BrokenPipe error in seq_iter (#83)
* **Deprecates `seq_iter` for a new function `sarsd_iter` which returns `state, action, reward, next_state, is_next_state_terminal`**
* Fixes an issue where trajectories would complete the challenge but additional frames would be in the data (#127)
* Removes a corrupted data stream (tempting_capers_shapeshifter-14_...) (#130)
* Fixes an issue with the data downloader where the read operation would time out (#131)
* Adds **resuming of downloads to the data downloader!**
* Fixes massive issue with data alignment!
* Frames at the beginning of experiments with teleportation are (mostly) removed!
* Fixes an issue where random rewards would appear during experiments (opening a furnace).
* Adjusts the brightness levels of the simulator and dataset to gamma=2.
* Adds ambient occlusion to the dataset and the simulator to slightly improve graphical quality!
* Fixes an issue where items would sometimes disappear from the inventory of player trajectories while they crafted.
* Adds a versioning system to the dataset, **requiring that you use the latest version associated with your MineRL package.**


**SUBMISSIONS SHOULD BE OPEN NEXT WEEK SO GET EXCITED!**  ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯

The awesome folks over at PFN **have released some initial baselines in their framework ChainerRL** on some of the auxiliary envrionments (Treechop + Navigate)! 

**[Check out their amazing work here!](https://github.com/minerllabs/quick_start/tree/master/chainerrl_baselines)**

<img src="/assets/images/MineRLTreechop-v0.png" width="80%"/>

They've released DDDQN, Rainbow, & PPO, and they solved `MineRLTreechop`!  Feel free to ask them if you have any questions!

**Note:** when AIcrowd releases the competition submission and evaluation kit these baselines will be converted into that format an appear on the leaderboard. So **check back for updates**.
