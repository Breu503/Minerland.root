We are excited to announce the beginning of the [MineRL competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/organizers/minerl/challenges/neurips-2019-minerl-competition/)! 
Documentation of the environment and accessing the data is available at [http://www.minerl.io/docs/](http://www.minerl.io/docs/)

This is the first ever publishing of the minerl package, so we are paying special attention to feedback from the community during this exploratory period. Please note [bugs](https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl/issues) may be encountered. **As a result submissions are not yet possible**. 

Through our generous partner Prefered Networks, we are working to release a set of benchmarks for the environment. A release date will be announced soon!

**To get started with the environment and dataset [please check out our quick start guide here](http://minerl.io/docs/tutorials/getting_started.html)!**
