Are you interested in creating bots for Minecraft, or even competing in the [Diamond](/diamond) or [BASALT](/basalt) competitions, but do not know where to start?
**Then this is the event for you!**

Join us during our workshop to complete tasks specifically designed to ease the entry into the AI development in Minecraft! The best part? We (the organizers) will be present to tutor and help you out! We hope that every participant leaves the workshop with freshly gained skills to work towards better AI with the [MineRL environment](/index)!

We realize that you, our dear reader, might be well versed in the runes of Python as is, or maybe you already master the arcane dark arts of machine learning. Considering this,
we will target the tasks towards three groups:

* *Newcomer*: you are new to programming and the MineRL environment (maybe familiar with Minecraft). We are happy to get you started by making simple Minecraft bots, but please take care to complete the steps listed below in prerequisites!
* *Programmer*: you are familiar with programming. Your adventure will start with getting MineRL environment running and maybe a touch of machine learning!
* *Machine learner*: you are already familiar with machine learning (e.g. computer vision, reinforcement learning, etc), and are keen to try out MineRL. We will prep you to start competing in the competitions right away!

<h3 style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">Prerequisites</h3>

We wish to assist you regardless of your proficiency in programming or machine learning, but that being said, we ask that you at least...

* have a stable internet connection to communicate with us and to run MineRL environment, either locally or on [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)
* have basic Python knowledge. Read through *at least* three first chapters of [this tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). Go through the first few Colab example notebooks if you intend to use it.
* have tried installing the [MineRL environment](https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl) on your machine. Do not fear if it fails! You can still use Colab to run MineRL! 
* bring a microphone and a webcam with you for gather.town. This is not a hard requirement, but it will make communication much more fluent! Be prepared to share your screen with tutors, in case there are some code bits you need help with.

<h3 style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">Schedule and venue</h3>

Event takes place on **August 5th**, encompassing time zones from the **west-coast US to Japan**. Detailed schedule will be added here later. The workshop is split into sessions of two-three hours each. You are free to join any of the sessions at any time!

We will be using the [gather.town](https://gather.town/) platform with a small classroom setup. This is both fun and functional, where we tutors can jump around and help everyone individually, instead of plain-old video lecture! **Note** that the meeting room can only fit a limited number of participants at any given time.

Link to the gather.town meeting will be shared here on this webpage once the workshop starts!
