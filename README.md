# public-site
This is the ONLY repository for MineRL's web presence

If you want to run the site locally, you can do so with `./test` 

1) Ask Brandon or Will for WebDev-S3 Credentials
2) Configure AWS CLI
3) run ./test to test your changes
4) deploy changes with ./update

Links are relative and don't need index.html or the website URL to be specified
Only new files are uploaded - exising ones are not touched
