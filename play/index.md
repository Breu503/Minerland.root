We'd love to have you play Minecraft with us! Our server is free and public, but there are a few steps before you can get started.

1. Purchase and install Minecraft Java Edition on your computer ([Available here](http://minecraft.net))
2. Run the MineRL Recording Mod installer: [Windows]({{site.url}}/downloads/installer-signed.exe), [Linux]({{site.url}}/downloads/minerl_installer.jar),  [Mac]({{site.url}}/downloads/minerl_installer.dmg)
    1. If you already play with Forge for Minecraft 1.12, you can install our mod directly: [Download here]({{site.url}}/downloads/minerl.jar)
3. Read and fill out our consent form to indicate that you understand your gameplay will be recorded anonymously: [Here](http://herobraine.stream/consent_form/). *Make sure to use your Minecraft username.*
4. Launch Minecraft with the newly installed configuration and connect to **mc.minerl.io**
