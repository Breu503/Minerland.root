## BASALT: A MineRL Competition on Solving Human-Judged Tasks 

This year, we are adding a new competition to the MineRL family: BASALT, a competition on solving human-judged tasks. The tasks in this competition do not have a pre-defined reward function: the goal is to produce trajectories that are judged by real humans to be effective at solving a given task.
We realize this is somewhat uncharted territory for the ML community, and that it will require a different set of norms and training procedures - perhaps integrating demonstrations with sources of live human ranking, rating, or comparison to guide agents in the right direction. Our hope is that this competition can provide an impetus for the research community to build these new procedures, which we expect will become increasingly relevant as we want artificially intelligent systems to integrate into more areas of our lives.



### FULL COMPETITION INFO COMING SOON! 

We're still finalizing the full set of rules and competition info; check back here in mid-June!
